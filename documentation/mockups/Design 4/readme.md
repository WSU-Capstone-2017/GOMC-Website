# Mockup 4
This was built in code from a template downloaded from : http://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates/page218/nitro

Within this folder you will find a .html and .css file consisting of the code for the main page.

Please download the zip and run the index.html to view

## Design Scheme
With this mockup I wanted to go for a more clean cut look.

The color scheme chosen here is white with a bit of transitions involved

This mockup features some sliding transitions and a sticky nav bar on desktop, also a logo-less look on the mobile view focusing directly on text-content
