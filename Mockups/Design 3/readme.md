This was built in code from a template downloaded from quackit at the following link:

Within this folder you will find a .html and .css file consisting of the code for the main page.

## Design Scheme
With this mockup I wanted to go for a more corporate look, this design has less of a focus on images and uses a bit of gradients to kind of balance the color scheme.

The color scheme chosen here is an overarching green.

This mockup features a sticky header, rotating carousel and a search bar.
